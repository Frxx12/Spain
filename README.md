Live Link: https://github.com/Frxx12/Spain


Tech Used: HTML / CSS / JS


Goal: My goal is build a proffesional website about my portfolio

Screenshots: (insert 2–3)


Challenges & Fixes: (2–3 sentences)
One challenge in the code was ensuring that project filtering worked correctly, because the visible tag names didn’t always match the shorter keywords stored in each project's data-tags. This could cause some projects not to appear when a tag was clicked. The fix was to align the tag text with the tag data—either by adjusting data-tags to match visible labels or by adding a small mapping in JavaScript so both sides use consistent keywords.


Next Step Ideas: (1 sentence)
My next idea will be to add some helpful pictures about programming (so-called protips) that can be viewed without opening other websites
